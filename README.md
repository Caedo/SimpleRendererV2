# SimpleRendererV2

Graphics library made with simplicity in mind.

## Library includes:
- simple window and GL context creation using GLFW and GLAD,
- mesh creation,
- assets loading (shaders, textures, fonts...), 
- basic text rendering,
- Utility libraries (Dear ImGui, Raymath, stb),
- memory management utility.

SimpleRenderer is written in C-style C++, without using STL - all needed data structures and functions have basic implementation, so you can see how things works under the hood. It is not optimized for high performance.
